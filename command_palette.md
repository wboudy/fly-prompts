## Bootstrap: Register Roles and Thread

### Goal
Establish one broadcast-safe coordination thread before any edits.

### Inputs
- Team roster and intended role split.
- Proposed `thread_id`.
- Initial file-surface ownership map.

### Instructions
- Use one `thread_id` across all agents and include it in Agent Mail subjects.
- Reserve file surfaces before edits (`claim`, `owner`, `paths`) and avoid overlap.
- Keep non-doers read-only unless a new handoff explicitly reassigns ownership.
- If command flags are unclear, run `br --help` (or tool-specific `--help`) before execution.

Goal:
- Confirm one `thread_id` and shared mission statement.

Roles:
- Elect a Captain and assign Doer roles.
- Post exclusive file surfaces per role.

Steps:
1. Post `thread_id` and role table in Agent Mail.
2. Each agent ACKs with role + owned surfaces.
3. Captain confirms no overlapping reservations.

Sync:
- Gate: no implementation begins until all ACKs are posted.
- Any ownership change requires a new handoff message.

- Report: status, changed files, validations, and ownership handoff.
- Include the sync gate result (`make lint`, `make build`, tests/tool checks run).
- If blocked, name blocker, owner, and exact next action.

Done:
- All agents ACKed and ownership boundaries are conflict-free.

### Output
- One ACK per agent with role and reserved paths.
- Explicit "ready for next handoff" line.

## Plan: CASS Context to Beads

### Goal
Convert context into an execution plan with small, ordered beads.

### Inputs
- Current objective and constraints.
- Relevant history from CASS.
- Existing branch status and known risks.

### Instructions
- Use one `thread_id` across all agents and include it in Agent Mail subjects.
- Reserve file surfaces before edits (`claim`, `owner`, `paths`) and avoid overlap.
- Keep non-doers read-only unless a new handoff explicitly reassigns ownership.
- If command flags are unclear, run `br --help` (or tool-specific `--help`) before execution.

Goal:
- Produce a minimal, testable implementation plan.

Roles:
- Planner drafts the sequence.
- Captain validates ownership and dependency order.

Steps:
1. Query CASS for prior decisions and failed attempts.
2. Draft milestones and acceptance checks.
3. Initialize tracking: `br init` (or `bd init` if alias).
4. Create beads with explicit owners, surfaces, and done criteria.
5. If flags/options are uncertain, run `br --help` before proceeding.

Sync:
- Gate: beads must map 1:1 to owned surfaces and validation commands.
- Broadcast the plan in Agent Mail using the shared `thread_id`.

- Report: status, changed files, validations, and ownership handoff.
- Include the sync gate result (`make lint`, `make build`, tests/tool checks run).
- If blocked, name blocker, owner, and exact next action.

Done:
- Bead list is ordered, owned, and ready for implementation.

### Output
- Plan summary with dependencies.
- Bead IDs + owners + acceptance checks.

## Implement: Claim, Reserve, Code, UBS, Close

### Goal
Execute assigned beads with explicit reservations and safe sync points.

### Inputs
- Assigned bead IDs and acceptance criteria.
- Reserved file surfaces.
- Current branch and test/lint commands.

### Instructions
- Use one `thread_id` across all agents and include it in Agent Mail subjects.
- Reserve file surfaces before edits (`claim`, `owner`, `paths`) and avoid overlap.
- Keep non-doers read-only unless a new handoff explicitly reassigns ownership.
- If command flags are unclear, run `br --help` (or tool-specific `--help`) before execution.

Goal:
- Land code changes for assigned beads without ownership conflicts.

Roles:
- Doer edits only reserved surfaces.
- Review partner stays read-only until handoff.

Steps:
1. Claim bead in Agent Mail (`thread_id`, bead ID, reserved paths).
2. Implement only on reserved files.
3. Run local checks required by bead.
4. Run UBS for touched code paths before closing bead.
5. Update bead status and close when acceptance checks pass.

Sync:
- Gate: no bead closure without check outputs + UBS mention.
- Post reservation release or transfer in Agent Mail.

- Report: status, changed files, validations, and ownership handoff.
- Include the sync gate result (`make lint`, `make build`, tests/tool checks run).
- If blocked, name blocker, owner, and exact next action.

Done:
- Bead closed with evidence, and reservations updated.

### Output
- Change summary by file.
- Validation list (lint/build/tests/UBS) and bead closure note.

## Review: Quality Gate with UBS and DCG

### Goal
Run a focused review pass to catch regressions before release.

### Inputs
- Candidate diff/commit range.
- Acceptance criteria from plan/beads.
- Safety policies for destructive commands.

### Instructions

Goal:
- Approve only changes that satisfy behavior, safety, and ownership rules.

Roles:
- Reviewer inspects diff and checks.
- Doer addresses findings on owned surfaces.

Steps:
1. Review changed files for correctness and scope drift.
2. Re-run required checks and confirm outputs.
3. Run UBS on changed code areas and note findings.
4. Confirm DCG protections are respected for risky operations.
5. Request fixes or approve with explicit rationale.

Sync:
- Gate: no release handoff until blockers are resolved.
- Send findings in Agent Mail with `thread_id`, severity, owner.

- Report: status, changed files, validations, and ownership handoff.
- Include the sync gate result (`make lint`, `make build`, tests/tool checks run).
- If blocked, name blocker, owner, and exact next action.

Done:
- Review decision posted (approved or blocked) with concrete evidence.

### Output
- Findings list by severity.
- Final gate status and next owner.

## Release: Sync Gate, SLB, Deploy

### Goal
Ship validated changes with explicit sync gates and operator checks.

### Inputs
- Approved commit set.
- Required release checklist.
- CI and deployment context.

### Instructions
- Use one `thread_id` across all agents and include it in Agent Mail subjects.
- Reserve file surfaces before edits (`claim`, `owner`, `paths`) and avoid overlap.
- Keep non-doers read-only unless a new handoff explicitly reassigns ownership.

- Release owner runs checks and deploy commands.
- Observer verifies commands and outcomes.

Steps:
1. Run release gate checks (`make lint`, `make build`, tests as required).
2. Confirm no unresolved review blockers.
3. Use SLB workflow where two-person authorization is required.
4. Deploy using project-approved commands.
5. If command details are unclear, run `br --help` and tool `--help` first.

Sync:
- Gate: deploy starts only after gate checks + approvals are posted.
- Post release status in Agent Mail (`thread_id`, version/commit, outcome).

- Report: status, changed files, validations, and ownership handoff.
- Include the sync gate result (`make lint`, `make build`, tests/tool checks run).
- If blocked, name blocker, owner, and exact next action.

Done:
- Deployment result and rollback posture are documented.

### Output
- Release checklist results.
- Deploy outcome, follow-ups, and owner.
- Legacy prompts append check confirmed.

## Incident: Bug Hunt to Bead

### Goal
Triage an incident and convert it into an owned, testable bead.

- Keep non-doers read-only unless a new handoff explicitly reassigns ownership.
- If command flags are unclear, run `br --help` (or tool-specific `--help`) before execution.

Goal:
- Reproduce, contain, and route the fix with clear ownership.

Roles:
- Incident lead coordinates triage.
- Fix owner implements and validates remediation.

Steps:
1. Capture minimal repro and blast radius.
2. Search CASS for related incidents and prior fixes.
3. Create/assign a bead for remediation (`br init` or `bd init` if alias).
4. Implement fix on reserved surfaces and add/adjust tests.
5. Run UBS on changed code and attach relevant results.

Sync:
- Gate: incident is not closed until repro is resolved and checks pass.
- Post timeline updates in Agent Mail with `thread_id` and next checkpoint.

- Report: status, changed files, validations, and ownership handoff.
- Include the sync gate result (`make lint`, `make build`, tests/tool checks run).
- If blocked, name blocker, owner, and exact next action.

Done:
- Incident status, fix bead, and verification evidence are recorded.

### Output
- Triage summary and root-cause hypothesis.

## Planning

### Onboard & Orient
```
<instructions>
You are starting a new session. Complete these orientation steps before any coding.
</instructions>

<steps>
1. Read AGENTS.md and README.md in full — understand project conventions
2. Register with Agent Mail using your pane name (e.g., cc_1)
3. Check your inbox for messages from other agents or the overseer
4. Search project history: `cass search "<project name>" --days 7 --limit 5`
5. Run `bd ready` to see available work — do NOT claim yet
6. Send a brief intro message via Agent Mail announcing your presence
7. Review `bv` or `bd list --status=in_progress` to see what others are doing
</steps>

<cass_tips>
Use CASS to understand recent context:
- `cass search "error" --workspace .` — Recent errors in this project
- `cass search "refactor" --days 3` — Recent refactoring discussions
- `cass context src/main.ts` — Sessions that touched a key file
</cass_tips>

<constraints>
- Do NOT start coding until orientation is complete
- Do NOT claim beads during onboard — that comes after planning
- Do NOT skip reading AGENTS.md even if you have seen it before
- Do NOT skip CASS search — context from past sessions is valuable
</constraints>
```

### Create Initial Plan
```
<instructions>
Create a structured plan before implementation. Think deeply about architecture before writing code.
</instructions>

<context_gathering>
Before planning:
1. Search for prior art: `cass search "<feature or problem>" --limit 5`
2. Review existing architecture: read README, AGENTS.md, key source files
3. Identify constraints: performance, compatibility, dependencies
</context_gathering>

<architecture_thinking>
For non-trivial features, sketch the design:

1. **State Machine** (if stateful):
   - What states can the system be in?
   - What transitions are valid?
   - What triggers each transition?
   
2. **Data Flow**:
   - Where does data enter the system?
   - How is it transformed?
   - Where does it exit?

3. **Component Boundaries**:
   - What modules are involved?
   - What are the interfaces between them?
   - What can change independently?
</architecture_thinking>

<state_machine_format>
States: [list]
Transitions:
  <from> → <to>: <trigger>
  <from> → <to>: <trigger>
Initial: <state>
Terminal: [states]
</state_machine_format>

<example_state_machine>
Feature: OAuth login flow

States: [unauthenticated, redirecting, callback_pending, authenticated, error]
Transitions:
  unauthenticated → redirecting: user clicks "Login with Google"
  redirecting → callback_pending: redirect to OAuth provider
  callback_pending → authenticated: valid callback with token
  callback_pending → error: invalid callback or denied
  error → unauthenticated: user clicks "Try again"
  authenticated → unauthenticated: logout or token expiry
Initial: unauthenticated
Terminal: []
</example_state_machine>

<steps>
1. Identify the goal — from beads, Agent Mail, or overseer instructions
2. Gather context — search CASS, read existing code
3. Sketch architecture — state machines, data flow, components
4. Break work into discrete subtasks (3-7 steps ideal)
5. Identify risks and unknowns
6. Share your plan via Agent Mail — tag relevant agents
7. Wait for feedback before proceeding to bead creation
</steps>

<output_format>
## Plan: <feature or goal>

### Context
- Prior art: <CASS findings or "none found">
- Existing components affected: <list>

### Architecture
<state machine or data flow diagram if applicable>

### Tasks
1. <task>
2. <task>
...

### Risks & Unknowns
- <risk or question>

### Dependencies
- Blocked by: <list or "none">
- Blocks: <list or "none">
</output_format>

<constraints>
- Do NOT skip CASS search — prior art saves time
- Do NOT skip architecture for non-trivial features
- Do NOT start implementing during planning
- Do NOT create beads yet — that is a separate step after plan approval
</constraints>
```

### Generate Brilliant Ideas
```
<instructions>
Diverge then converge. Generate many ideas, then ruthlessly filter to the best.
</instructions>

<phase_1_diverge>
Generate 100 ideas for improving the codebase, feature, or problem at hand.
- Include wild ideas, safe ideas, and everything between
- Do not self-censor during generation
- Aim for quantity over quality in this phase
</phase_1_diverge>

<phase_2_evaluate>
Score each idea on two axes (1-10):
- Impact: How much value does this deliver?
- Effort: How hard is this to implement? (10 = easy, 1 = hard)
</phase_2_evaluate>

<phase_3_converge>
Select the top 10 ideas by impact/effort ratio.
Create beads for the winners: `bd create --title="..." --priority=N`
Share your recommendations via Agent Mail.
</phase_3_converge>

<constraints>
- Do NOT stop at 20 ideas — push to 100
- Do NOT implement during ideation — this is planning only
- Do NOT skip the scoring step
</constraints>
```

### Coordinate Plans
```
<instructions>
Multiple agents are active. Align plans to avoid conflicts and duplicate work.
</instructions>

<steps>
1. Check Agent Mail for other agents' announced plans
2. Run `bd list --status=in_progress` to see claimed work
3. Identify overlaps — same files, same features, same beads
4. Message conflicting agents directly with a coordination proposal
5. Agree on division: who owns what files/beads
6. Update beads to reflect the agreed split
</steps>

<output_format>
After coordination, post to Agent Mail:
- Agents involved: [names]
- Division agreed: [who does what]
- Beads reassigned: [if any]
</output_format>

<constraints>
- Do NOT start work until conflicts are resolved
- Do NOT assume silence is agreement — get explicit confirmation
- Do NOT claim beads another agent is already working on
</constraints>
```

### Clarify Requirements
```
<instructions>
The plan may be underspecified. Ask questions until there is zero ambiguity.
</instructions>

<process>
1. Review the current goal, beads, or instructions
2. Identify every assumption you are making
3. List every ambiguous point — scope, format, edge cases, priorities
4. Formulate specific questions for each ambiguity
5. Send questions to the overseer via Agent Mail or direct message
6. WAIT for answers before proceeding
7. Repeat until no ambiguities remain
</process>

<question_format>
For each ambiguity, ask:
- Context: [what you are trying to decide]
- Options: [the choices you see]
- Recommendation: [what you would pick and why]
- Question: [what you need answered]
</question_format>

<example>
Context: User auth flow for the new signup feature
Options: (A) Email/password only (B) OAuth + email (C) OAuth only
Recommendation: B — flexibility without forcing OAuth
Question: Which auth approach should I implement?
</example>

<constraints>
- Do NOT guess on ambiguous requirements — ask
- Do NOT ask vague questions — be specific with options
- Do NOT proceed until you receive explicit answers
- Do NOT batch more than 5 questions at once — prioritize blockers
</constraints>
```

### Decompose Plan Into Beads
```
<instructions>
Convert an approved plan into atomic, trackable beads. Each bead should be a single logical unit of work that can be completed and verified independently.
</instructions>

<pre_check>
Before creating beads:
- Confirm the plan has been reviewed and approved
- Confirm all ambiguities have been resolved via `clarify`
- Search past work: `cass search "<project or feature>" --limit 5`
</pre_check>

<decomposition_rules>
1. Each bead = one logical unit of work (single feature, fix, or change)
2. Beads should be independently testable where possible
3. Prefer smaller beads — they parallelize better across agents
4. Set dependencies explicitly: if B requires A, link them
5. Use clear, action-oriented titles: "Implement X" not "X stuff"
6. Include acceptance criteria in the bead description
</decomposition_rules>

<steps>
1. List all tasks from the approved plan
2. For each task, assess scope — split if it touches multiple components
3. Identify dependencies between tasks
4. Create beads with proper metadata:
   `bd create --title="<action>: <target>" --type=<task|bug|feature> --priority=<0-4>`
5. Add dependencies: `bd dep add <child-id> <parent-id>`
6. Add descriptions with acceptance criteria: `bd update <id> --description="..."`
7. Validate with BV: `bv --robot-insights` — check for cycles or issues
8. Post summary to Agent Mail: "Created N beads for <plan>: <list of IDs>"
</steps>

<bead_format>
Title: <verb> <object> — e.g., "Implement OAuth callback handler"
Type: task | bug | feature | docs | test
Priority: 0 (critical) to 4 (backlog)
Description: |
  ## Goal
  <what this achieves>
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] <measurable outcome>
  - [ ] <measurable outcome>
  
  ## Notes
  <any context or gotchas>
</bead_format>

<example>
Plan: "Add user authentication with OAuth"

Beads created:
1. bd-a1b2c3: "Implement OAuth provider configuration" (priority 1)
2. bd-d4e5f6: "Implement OAuth callback handler" (priority 1, depends on bd-a1b2c3)
3. bd-g7h8i9: "Add session management middleware" (priority 1, depends on bd-d4e5f6)
4. bd-j0k1l2: "Write OAuth integration tests" (priority 2, depends on bd-g7h8i9)
5. bd-m3n4o5: "Update README with auth setup" (priority 3, depends on bd-g7h8i9)

Validation: `bv --robot-insights` shows no cycles, clear critical path through auth chain.

Agent Mail: "Created 5 beads for OAuth implementation: bd-a1b2c3 → bd-d4e5f6 → bd-g7h8i9 → bd-j0k1l2, bd-m3n4o5. Ready for review."
</example>

<constraints>
- Do NOT create beads for unresolved or ambiguous requirements
- Do NOT create beads that touch multiple unrelated components — split them
- Do NOT forget to set dependencies — orphan beads cause chaos
- Do NOT skip acceptance criteria — vague beads lead to vague implementations
- Do NOT skip `bv --robot-insights` validation — catch cycles early
</constraints>
```

### Review & Revise Beads
```
<instructions>
Review newly created beads before implementation begins. Use BV analysis to catch structural issues. It is far cheaper to fix a bad plan than a bad implementation.
</instructions>

<bv_analysis>
Run these BV commands to understand the bead graph:
- `bv --robot-triage` — Full analysis: recommendations, quick wins, blockers
- `bv --robot-insights` — Graph metrics: cycles, bottlenecks, PageRank
- `bv --robot-plan` — Execution plan with parallel tracks
- `bv --robot-priority` — Priority recommendations with reasoning
</bv_analysis>

<review_checklist>
For each bead, verify:
- [ ] Title is clear and action-oriented
- [ ] Scope is a single logical unit (not multiple unrelated changes)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- [ ] Dependencies are correctly set (no missing links)
- [ ] Priority reflects actual importance
- [ ] No duplicate or overlapping beads

From BV analysis, check:
- [ ] No dependency cycles (`bv --robot-insights` → cycles array)
- [ ] Bottlenecks are appropriately prioritized
- [ ] Critical path makes sense
- [ ] Parallel tracks are identified for multi-agent work
</review_checklist>

<steps>
1. Run `bv --robot-triage` for full analysis
2. Check insights for cycles — these MUST be fixed
3. Review priority recommendations — adjust if BV suggests changes
4. Review execution plan — verify parallel tracks make sense
5. For each bead, apply the review checklist
6. Revise problematic beads:
   - Split large beads: create new ones, close original with note
   - Clarify vague beads: `bd update <id> --description="..."`
   - Fix dependencies: `bd dep add/remove`
   - Fix cycles: remove or reverse problematic dependencies
7. Re-run `bv --robot-insights` to confirm fixes
8. Post review summary to Agent Mail
</steps>

<output_format>
Bead Review Summary:
- Reviewed: <count> beads
- BV Analysis:
  - Cycles: <none | list>
  - Bottlenecks: <list of high-PageRank beads>
  - Parallel tracks: <count>
- Approved as-is: <list>
- Revised: <list with changes>
- Split: <original> → <new beads>
- Flagged for discussion: <list with questions>
</output_format>

<example>
Bead Review Summary:
- Reviewed: 5 beads
- BV Analysis:
  - Cycles: none
  - Bottlenecks: bd-d4e5f6 (OAuth callback) — high PageRank, blocks 3 beads
  - Parallel tracks: 2 (auth chain + docs)
- Approved as-is: bd-a1b2c3, bd-d4e5f6, bd-g7h8i9
- Revised:
  - bd-j0k1l2: Added missing acceptance criteria for test coverage %
- Split: none
- Flagged for discussion: none

All beads ready for implementation. Recommend 2 agents: one on auth chain, one on docs.
</example>

<constraints>
- Do NOT approve beads with dependency cycles — fix them first
- Do NOT ignore BV priority recommendations without justification
- Do NOT approve vague beads — push back for clarity
- Do NOT rubber-stamp — actually read each bead
- Do NOT implement during review — this is planning only
- Cast a wider net: check if the bead set misses areas that will be affected by the planned changes
</constraints>
```

---

## Implementing

### Swarm Open Beads
```
<instructions>
Claim and work through available beads systematically. Coordinate via Agent Mail.
</instructions>

<pre_check>
Before claiming work, confirm you understand project conventions:
- If this is your first bead this session, re-skim AGENTS.md
- If context was recently compacted, refresh on README.md
- If unsure about workflow, check AGENTS.md before proceeding
</pre_check>

<safety_tools>
DCG (Destructive Command Guard) is active as a hook. If it blocks a command:
- Do NOT attempt to bypass or work around it
- Reconsider whether the command is necessary
- If genuinely needed, use `ntm approve` to request human sign-off
- For dangerous ops (force push, rm -rf), use `slb run "<command>"` for two-person auth
</safety_tools>

<exploration_mindset>
When implementing, don't just tunnel-vision on the bead's files:
- Before coding, randomly explore 2-3 neighboring files to build context
- Trace the execution flow upstream and downstream of your change
- Check if similar patterns exist elsewhere — learn from them or fix them
- Cast a wider net: your change might break assumptions in files you didn't expect
</exploration_mindset>

<steps>
1. Run `bd ready` to see beads with no blockers
2. Check Agent Mail for any claimed work or active discussions
3. Pick a bead matching your skills — prefer highest priority
4. Claim it: `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`
5. Announce via Agent Mail: "Claiming <bead-id>: <title>"
6. Explore neighboring code before diving in (see exploration_mindset)
7. Implement the task fully
8. Close when done: `bd close <id> --reason="Completed"`
9. Repeat from step 1
</steps>

<constraints>
- Do NOT claim more than one bead at a time
- Do NOT work on beads marked in_progress by others
- Do NOT forget to announce claims via Agent Mail
- Do NOT leave beads in_progress when context is exhausted — hand off or pause
</constraints>
```

### Fresh Eyes: Bug Hunt
```
<instructions>
Randomly explore the codebase with fresh eyes. Trace execution flows, find bugs and mistakes that familiarity blinds you to.
</instructions>

<exploration_mode>
Do NOT start from recent diffs or commits. Instead, randomly walk the codebase:
1. Pick a source file at random — not one you've recently touched
2. Read it deeply. Understand its purpose in the larger system
3. Trace its imports — follow the dependency chain up and down
4. Trace its execution flow — what calls it? What does it call?
5. Once you understand the context, scrutinize it with fresh eyes
6. Move to another random file. Repeat.

Cast a wide net. Don't restrict yourself to recently changed code — bugs live everywhere, especially in code nobody has looked at in a while.
</exploration_mode>

<what_to_find>
- Obvious bugs, logic errors, off-by-one mistakes
- Silly mistakes: typos in variable names, wrong comparisons, swapped arguments
- Missing error handling, uncaught exceptions
- Race conditions, state corruption
- Dead code paths that should have been removed
- Incorrect assumptions in comments vs actual behavior
</what_to_find>

<steps>
1. List all source directories and pick entry points at random
2. For each file: read → trace → understand → scrutinize
3. When you find an issue, fix it immediately if safe, or create a bead
4. Keep a running tally of files explored and issues found
5. Aim for breadth — explore at least 10-15 files across different modules
6. Post findings via Agent Mail
</steps>

<output_format>
## Bug Hunt Results

Files explored: <count>
Issues found: <count>
Fixed: <list with brief descriptions>
Beads created: <list>
Clean files: <list of files that looked solid>
</output_format>

<constraints>
- Do NOT only look at recent changes — the whole codebase is fair game
- Do NOT skim — read each file thoroughly before moving on
- Do NOT rewrite working code for style — focus on actual bugs
- Do NOT skip test files — they have bugs too
- Comply with ALL rules in AGENTS.md and best practice guides referenced there
</constraints>
```

### Fresh Eyes: Peer Review
```
<instructions>
Review code written by other agents. Go deep on root causes, not just symptoms. Cast a wider net than recent commits.
</instructions>

<approach>
This is adversarial review — assume bugs exist and hunt for them.
Don't restrict yourself to the latest commits. Cast a wider net:
- Check git log for all recent agent work across the last week
- Look at files those commits touched AND their neighbors
- Follow the ripple — a change in one file can break assumptions elsewhere
- Use first-principles analysis: does this code actually do what it claims?
</approach>

<what_to_find>
- Bugs, errors, logic problems in agent-written code
- Inefficiencies — O(n²) where O(n) would work, unnecessary allocations
- Security problems — injection, auth bypass, data exposure, path traversal
- Reliability issues — missing retries, no timeouts, silent failures
- Incorrect error handling — swallowed errors, wrong error types
- Broken assumptions — code that works by accident, not by design
</what_to_find>

<root_cause_analysis>
When you find an issue, don't just patch the symptom:
1. What is the surface-level bug?
2. WHY does this bug exist? What assumption failed?
3. Are there other places with the same flawed assumption?
4. What systemic fix prevents this class of bug?
</root_cause_analysis>

<steps>
1. Run `git log --all --oneline --since="7 days ago"` to see all recent work
2. Group commits by author/agent
3. For each agent's work: read the changes AND surrounding code
4. Trace execution flows through modified code
5. Apply root-cause analysis to every issue found
6. Fix issues or create beads with detailed root-cause descriptions
7. Post review findings via Agent Mail, tagging relevant agents
</steps>

<constraints>
- Do NOT restrict yourself to the latest commits — cast a wider net and go deep
- Do NOT just flag issues — diagnose root causes
- Do NOT skip security review — treat every input as hostile
- Do NOT assume other agents tested their code thoroughly
- Use ultrathink for complex analysis
</constraints>
```

### Fresh Eyes: UX Polish
```
<instructions>
Scrutinize the application from a user's perspective. Find everything that feels sub-optimal, clunky, or unpolished. The quality bar is Stripe-level.
</instructions>

<mindset>
You are a demanding user encountering this app for the first time.
Everything that makes you pause, squint, or feel confused is a bug.
Everything that could be smoother, slicker, or more intuitive is an opportunity.
</mindset>

<what_to_scrutinize>
- **Workflows:** Walk through every user-facing flow end-to-end. Where does it feel clunky?
- **UI polish:** Spacing, alignment, typography, color consistency, loading states
- **Error states:** What happens when things go wrong? Are error messages helpful or cryptic?
- **Edge cases:** Empty states, long strings, slow connections, rapid clicks
- **Micro-interactions:** Hover states, transitions, feedback on actions
- **Copy:** Is the text clear, concise, and consistent? Any jargon leaking through?
- **Performance feel:** Does anything feel sluggish? Unnecessary spinners?
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, contrast ratios
</what_to_scrutinize>

<quality_bar>
Think Stripe, Linear, Vercel — apps where every detail feels intentional:
- No orphaned pixels or misaligned elements
- Every action gives immediate, clear feedback
- Error recovery is graceful, not jarring
- The app anticipates what the user wants next
- Nothing feels like an afterthought
</quality_bar>

<steps>
1. Start as a new user — go through onboarding/setup if applicable
2. Walk through the primary user journey end-to-end
3. Walk through secondary flows (settings, edge cases, error paths)
4. Document every friction point, no matter how small
5. Prioritize: what's embarrassing vs. nice-to-have
6. Fix quick wins immediately, create beads for larger issues
7. Post UX audit via Agent Mail
</steps>

<output_format>
## UX Audit Results

### Critical (embarrassing if shipped)
- <issue + location + suggested fix>

### High (noticeably sub-optimal)
- <issue + location + suggested fix>

### Polish (would elevate quality)
- <issue + location + suggested fix>

### Praise (things that already feel great)
- <what works well>
</output_format>

<constraints>
- Do NOT only look at code — actually use the application
- Do NOT skip mobile/responsive if applicable
- Do NOT accept "it works" as sufficient — it must feel premium
- Do NOT limit yourself to visual issues — workflow design matters more
</constraints>
```

### Deep Diff Review
```
<instructions>
Perform a thorough review of uncommitted or recent changes. Think like a skeptical reviewer.
</instructions>

<steps>
1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to see all changes
2. For each file, ask: "What could go wrong here?"
3. Trace data flow — where does input come from, where does output go?
4. Cast a wider net: check files that import or are imported by changed files — changes ripple
5. Check boundary conditions and error paths
6. Look for security issues: injection, auth bypass, data exposure
7. Verify tests exist and cover new code paths
</steps>

<output_format>
Report findings as:
- File: [path]
- Line: [number]
- Issue: [description]
- Severity: [critical/high/medium/low]
- Suggested fix: [brief recommendation]
</output_format>

<constraints>
- Do NOT approve without thorough review
- Do NOT skip "boring" files like configs or tests
- Do NOT assume the author tested edge cases
</constraints>
```

### Compact Context
```
<instructions>
Your context window is filling up. Summarize progress and prepare for continuation.
</instructions>

<steps>
1. List what you have completed this session
2. List what remains to be done
3. Note any blockers, open questions, or partial work
4. Write a handoff summary to Agent Mail or a bead comment
5. Run `bd sync` to commit bead changes
6. Commit any code changes with clear messages
</steps>

<output_format>
Write a context summary:
---
Session Summary for [agent name]:
Completed: [list]
In Progress: [current bead, current file]
Remaining: [list]
Blockers: [any questions or dependencies]
Next agent should: [specific instruction]
---
</output_format>

<constraints>
- Do NOT lose work — commit and sync before compacting
- Do NOT leave ambiguous state — be explicit about what is done vs pending
- Do NOT skip the Agent Mail update if other agents are active
</constraints>
```

### Check Agent Mail
```
<instructions>
Check for messages from other agents or the overseer. Respond promptly.
</instructions>

<steps>
1. Check your Agent Mail inbox
2. Read all unread messages
3. For each message requiring action:
   - Acknowledge receipt
   - Take requested action or explain why you cannot
   - Update relevant beads if needed
4. For coordination requests, respond with your availability and plan
5. Mark messages as read once handled
</steps>

<constraints>
- Do NOT ignore messages — acknowledge even if you cannot act immediately
- Do NOT let inbox pile up — check regularly during long sessions
- Do NOT forget to update beads when mail changes your plan
</constraints>
```

## Deploying

### Commit Grouped Changes
```
<instructions>
Commit changes in logical groups with detailed messages. Quality commits make history useful.
</instructions>

<steps>
1. Run `git status` to see all changes
2. Group related changes by feature, fix, or concern
3. For each group:
   - Stage only those files: `git add <files>`
   - Write a detailed commit message (see format below)
   - Commit: `git commit`
4. Run `bd sync` to commit bead changes separately
5. Review commit history: `git log --oneline -10`
</steps>

<commit_format>
<type>(<scope>): <summary>

<body - what and why, not how>

<footer - bead refs, breaking changes>

Types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore
</commit_format>

<example>
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login flow

Implements Google OAuth2 as an alternative to email/password login.
Users can now click "Sign in with Google" on the login page.
Token refresh is handled automatically via middleware.

Closes: bd-a1b2c3
</example>

<constraints>
- Do NOT make one giant commit with unrelated changes
- Do NOT write vague messages like "fix stuff" or "updates"
- Do NOT commit generated files, secrets, or .env files
- Do NOT forget to sync beads after code commits
</constraints>
```

### Pre-Deploy Checks
```
<instructions>
Prepare for deployment. Catch issues before CI does. Use SLB for any dangerous operations.
</instructions>

<steps>
1. Run the full test suite — fix any failures
2. Run UBS (Ultimate Bug Scanner): `ubs scan .`
3. Review UBS findings — fix critical and high severity issues
4. Create beads for issues you cannot fix now: `bd create --title="..." --type=bug`
5. Run linter and formatter — commit any fixes
6. Check for uncommitted changes: `git status`
7. Ensure all beads are synced: `bd sync`
8. For any dangerous commands, route through SLB: `slb run "<command>"`
</steps>

<slb_integration>
SLB classifies commands by risk tier:
- CRITICAL (2+ approvals): data destruction, production deploys
- DANGEROUS (1 approval): force push, schema changes
- CAUTION (auto-approved after 30s): minor risky ops
- SAFE (skipped): read-only commands

Check classification: `slb check "<command>"`
</slb_integration>

<example_ubs_output>
$ ubs scan .
[CRITICAL] src/auth.ts:42 - SQL injection via unsanitized input
[HIGH] src/api.ts:118 - Missing rate limit on public endpoint
[MEDIUM] src/utils.ts:55 - Unused variable 'temp'

Action: Fix CRITICAL and HIGH before deploy. Create beads for MEDIUM.
</example_ubs_output>

<checklist>
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No critical UBS findings
- [ ] No uncommitted changes
- [ ] Beads synced
- [ ] README updated if needed
</checklist>

<constraints>
- Do NOT skip UBS scan
- Do NOT deploy with failing tests
- Do NOT ignore critical security findings
</constraints>
```

### Deploy & Wait
```
<instructions>
Push code and wait for CI. Do not spin or guess at failures.
</instructions>

<steps>
1. Push to remote: `git push` (or `slb run "git push --force"` if force-pushing)
2. Create PR if needed: `gh pr create`
3. Note the CI/deploy URL
4. STOP and WAIT — do not proceed until CI completes
5. If CI passes, report success via Agent Mail
6. If CI fails, proceed to debug_ci prompt
</steps>

<slb_reminder>
If any deploy step requires a dangerous command (force push, production deploy, database migration):
- Route through SLB: `slb run "<command>" --reason "<justification>"`
- Wait for approval before proceeding
- Check pending approvals: `ntm approve list`
</slb_reminder>

<example_success>
Agent Mail message after CI passes:
"Deploy complete. PR #142 merged. Vercel preview: https://app-git-feature-xyz.vercel.app"
</example_success>

<while_waiting>
Do NOT watch CI obsessively. Instead:
- Check Agent Mail for other tasks
- Review beads for low-priority work
- Document what you just shipped
- Or simply wait — idle time is acceptable
</while_waiting>

<constraints>
- Do NOT push again hoping it fixes CI
- Do NOT guess at CI failures — wait for logs
- Do NOT start new features while deploy is pending
</constraints>
```

### Debug CI Failure
```
<instructions>
CI failed. Diagnose systematically using available tools.
</instructions>

<steps>
1. Get the CI logs: `gh run view --log-failed` or check the CI URL
2. Identify the failing step and error message
3. Reproduce locally if possible
4. Run UBS on affected files: `ubs scan <path>`
5. Create a bead for the fix: `bd create --title="Fix CI: <issue>" --type=bug --priority=1`
6. Fix the issue
7. Run pre_deploy checks again before pushing
</steps>

<example>
CI log shows:
  FAIL src/auth.test.ts
  ✕ should reject expired tokens (42ms)
    Expected: 401
    Received: 200

Diagnosis: Token expiry check is missing.
Fix: Add expiry validation in validateToken().
Bead: `bd create --title="Fix CI: token expiry not validated" --type=bug --priority=1`
</example>

<common_failures>
- Test failure: Run the specific test locally, check for flaky tests
- Lint failure: Run linter locally, auto-fix if possible
- Build failure: Check dependencies, lock files, build config
- Timeout: Check for infinite loops, missing mocks, slow tests
</common_failures>

<constraints>
- Do NOT push blind fixes hoping they work
- Do NOT skip local reproduction
- Do NOT ignore flaky tests — fix or quarantine them
</constraints>
```

## Utilities

### Prepare Handoff
```
<instructions>
Prepare a complete handoff for the next agent or session.
</instructions>

<steps>
1. Commit all code changes with clear messages
2. Run `bd sync` to save bead state
3. Update any in_progress beads with status comments
4. Write a handoff document (see format below)
5. Post handoff to Agent Mail
6. Tag the next agent if known
</steps>

<handoff_format>
Handoff from [agent] at [timestamp]
Completed: [list]
In Progress: [bead ID + status]
Open Questions: [list]
Files Modified: [list]
Next Steps: [numbered actions]
Warnings: [gotchas]
</handoff_format>

<example>
Handoff from cc_1 at 2026-02-07 14:30

Completed:
- OAuth2 login flow (bd-a1b2c3)
- Token refresh middleware

In Progress:
- bd-d4e5f6: Logout endpoint — 80% done, needs tests

Open Questions:
- Should logout invalidate all sessions or just current?

Files Modified:
- src/auth/oauth.ts, src/middleware/refresh.ts

Next Steps:
1. Finish logout endpoint tests
2. Add session invalidation (pending answer)

Warnings:
- Google OAuth sandbox expires Feb 15 — need prod creds before then
</example>

2. Run `bd sync` to commit bead changes
3. Update in_progress beads — either close or add status comments
4. Post final status to Agent Mail
5. Push all commits: `git push`
6. Run `bd list --status=in_progress` — ensure nothing is orphaned
7. Sign off via Agent Mail
</steps>

<example_signoff>
cc_1 signing off at 2026-02-07 18:00

Session summary:
- Closed: bd-a1b2c3, bd-d4e5f6
- Left in progress: bd-g7h8i9 (blocked on API decision)
- Commits pushed: 4
- Tests passing: yes
