- Use one `thread_id` across all agents and include it in Agent Mail subjects.
- Reserve file surfaces before edits (`claim`, `owner`, `paths`) and avoid overlap.
- Keep non-doers read-only unless a new handoff explicitly reassigns ownership.
- If command flags are unclear, run `br --help` (or tool-specific `--help`) before execution.
